================== Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ==================
1. Define Work Breakdown Structure:
	WBS in a project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown
	of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable
	that organizes the team's work into manageable sections.
2. Own definition of Work Breakdown Structure:
	Breaking down project deliverables into smaller chunks that are less overwhelming for the team
3. Steps to creating a 'Work Breakdown Structure'
	- Determine the major deliverables or products to be produced (e.g. Create training program)
	- Divide each of the major deliverables into smaller components to be completed (e.g. Conduct interview)
	- Divide the smaller components into work pieces. (e.g. Select interviewees, prepare questions)
4. Relate to own project:
	In our group project, we would use a WBS to get a better idea on how to prepare and present the
	required deliverables. For example, in presenting a proof-of-concept we break it down to core deliverables
	such as the 'Website', 'Report' and 'Presentation'
	
	
================== Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) ==================
1. Define Product Breakdown Structure:
	A PBS is a tool for analyzing, documenting and communicating the outcomes of a project,
	and forms part of the product based planning technique
2. Own definition of Product Breakdown Structure:
	Breaking down the main product deliverables into smaller more manageable deliverables
3. Steps to creating a Product Breakdown Structure
	- Identify final product under evaluation
	- Breakdown final product into pieces that can be evaluated (encourages to consider minute details)
	- Breakdown the evaluated pieces into the most basic pieces (shows the required work)
4. Relate to own project: For example, in creating a website we break it down to core deliverables
	such as 'Design', 'Layout', 'Content', 'Proof-read', 'Publishing'
