========== Statement of Scope ==========
1. Define 'Project Scope'
	Project scope is the part of the project planning that involves determining and documenting
	a list of specific project goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines,
	and ultimately costs. It is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to
	deliver a project (1)
2. Define 'Statement of Scope'
	A project scope statement is a useful tool to outline the project's deliverables and
	identify the constraints, assumptions and key success factors. The well-written scope 
	statement clearly defines the boundaries of a project. Before the project begins, the 
	project team and the project stakeholders need to agree to the scope statement before
	the project execution (2)
