============= Lab Exercise 9 =============== Answer the following:
==== 1. What is a project management process model? What is it used for? ====
	A PM process model is an approach to carrying out the numerous stages of a project. Examples can be traditional
		'waterfall' or an agile approach such as the 'Spiral model'

==== 2. What fundamentally-different types of PM process models can you find? ====
	- Agile, for projects that require extreme flexibility and speed
	- Traditional, assess the tasks and provide a process to monitor completion
	- Waterfall, tasks accomplished in sequence, similar to Traditional
	- Adaptive, adjusting project scope as the project is being executed, new opportunities taken during duration
	- Critical Path, project tasks that are dependent on one another.
	- PERT, in development processes and manufacturing. Involves analyzing time/money taken to complete tasks
	- Rational Unified Process, waterfall method with numerous iterations
	- Critical chain, create goals and assemble teams based around their budget and other constraints
	- Extreme, reduce total time of each repetitive cycle within a project
	- Scrum, agile sprints
	- Six stigma, reduce waste, improve project processes and increase profits
	- Crystal, centered on the skills and interactions between people in the project to create unique product
	- Joint application development, working together with client
	
==== 3. What are the significant difference between each of your found-and-investigated process models? ====
	- The core difference is the approach taken (the model used), some are traditional where the tasks are completed in
		sequence and some are agile where the tasks are completed in sprints or iterations.
	- Other difference is what part of the project is most focused on. Some methodologies focus on just the tasks whereas
		the others focus on the team interactions or time/budget constraints
	
==== 4. Strengths & Weaknesses of each model ====
	- Agile,  Useful for projects with high flexibility. Useless in a project where the tasks are 'static' or well-defined
	- Traditional, Useful for projects with well-defined objectives. Useless in a project without well-defined goals
	- Waterfall,
	- Adaptive, Useful for exploratory projects where scope can change. Not useful for projects with high time/budget
		constraints
	- Critical path, Useful for project tasks with dependencies and set time durations. Difficult to use with tasks
		that don't have well defined time constraints
	- PERT, allows for realistic time lines and budgets for projects with similar predecessor projects. Not useful
		for exploratory projects where similar projects haven't been completed before.
	- Rational Unified Process, useful for software development where testing is a big phase of the project.
		The iterative style is not useful for projects with critical tasks or path with dependencies.
	- Critical chain, 
	- Extreme, 
	- Scrum, useful for projects with tasks that are not highly dependent on each other.

==== 5. What project characteristics should be considered when choosing on best-fit process model for the project? ====
	- Organizational goals						- Core values
	- Project constraints (time/budget)			- Project stakeholders
	- Project size								- Cost of the project
	- Ability to take risks						- Need for flexibility
	- Type of management needed
	
==== 6. Current state-of-play for various PM process models in practice ====

==== 7. Does a PM process model 'silver bullet' exist? ====
	No, there is no perfect or silver bullet process model. Some projects would be better with one methodology over
		the other. The methodology is to be decided based on project characteristics and other factors such as culture
		and organization.
